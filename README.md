# Nand2Tetris
In this course I built a modern software hierarchy,
designed to enable the translation and execution of object-based,
high-level languages on a bare-bone computer hardware platform.
In particular, I implemented a virtual machine and a compiler for a simple,
Java-like programming language,
and I developed a basic operating system that closes gaps between the high-level language and the underlying hardware platform.
In the process, I gained a deep, hands-on understanding of numerous topics in applied computer science, e.g. stack processing,
parsing, code generation, and classical algorithms and data structures for memory management,
vector graphics, input-output handling, and various other topics that lie at the very core of every modern computer system.

Note: project 10 is part 1 of project 11 therefore I just included project 11 in this repo.
