Remarks
-------
At first we implemented the Mult.asm so it would multiply every two numbers (positive and negative as well).
After finishing the implementation we suddenly realized we were supposed to multiply non-negative numbers only,
but because we felt our implementation performs extra (and as far as we checked it performs it correctly), we decided
to submit it.
